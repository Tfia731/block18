// Unit Tests:


// A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.
    // expect multiplication (number 1 * number 2)

// A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from both of the arrays.

    // Example: concatOdds([3, 2, 1], [9, 1, 1, 1, 4, 15, -1])
    // ...should result in [-1, 1, 3, 9, 15]

    
// Think about the following; you may need to make assumptions or decisions about the prompt and how the code should behave:

// What should happen with unexpected inputs?
    // The result should decide how they relate and/or sort accordingly. If the array is numbers as per above and an imput is not a number it should return an error message

// What kinds of unexpected inputs should we worry about?
    // random characters or letters if we are working with numbers.

// What should happen when there are multiples of the same odd number in the arrays? (Hint: We gave you the answer to this one in the example above.)
    // multiples are listed once and not repeated

// Functional Tests:

// A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either, but should be asked if they want to create an account or log in if they check out as a guest.

// Think about the following; you may need to make assumptions or decisions about the prompt and how the feature should behave:

// What should happen if the cart is empty?
    // if the cart is empty it will return a value of zero
// What needs to be shown to the user at each step of check out?
    // a log in screen, an option to bypass login, item as scanned, qualtity, price, coupons, deductions, subtotal, tax, total, payment method options, a receipt, a message showing the transaction is complete ("have a nice day!" message)

// What behaviors of this feature does the prompt miss or gloss over?
    // people who forgot their log in but still want to log in.


// Hint: Observe the shopping cart and checkout features of some popular websites to get some ideas!
